# Dantelion-FXR3-Editor
A visual .fxr editor for From Software games.


Compatibility:

- Elden Ring
Currently incompatible, it will probably become compatible in the future.

- Sekiro Shadows Die Twice
Largely compatible, a large amount of fxrs' can be opened and edited, far from reliable though.

- Dark Souls 3
99% compatible, a few issues are still present, with some .fxrs' not opening.

- Dark Souls 2/SOTFS 
Completely incompatible, it is unlikely it will ever be supported.

- Bloodborne
Currently incompatible, there are long term plans to support it.

- Dark Souls 1
Currently incompatible, there are long term plans to support it.
